Sriya 2/22:
I added the skeleton page for the home and login and was thinking of using a google api for login authentication which filters only UNCC emails. If loading up the site gives you an **error** please copy paste these commands into your terminal:
```bash
npm install bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom
```
bootstrap is framework that gives us a lot of pre-built components to make to site look nicer lol
react router dom is a JS library that gives us routing capabilities for the react app

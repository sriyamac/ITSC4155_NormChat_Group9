#Sriya 2/25:
currently using [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) as the DB for the chatbox and google login authentication feature. 

#Front-end TODO (most-least prio):
1. Feature where user can close out of the Chatbot conversation
2. Creating a Conversations list that is linked to the chatbox after user closes
3. Sign-out feature
4. Feedback page
5. Make the site look nice lol
